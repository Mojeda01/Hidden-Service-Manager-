# Hidden Service Manager 

Hidden Service Manager is a C++ project that automates the setup and control of Tor hidden services.
It validates configuration, generates `torrc`, spawns and monitors Tor, and registers onion addresses
programmatically. The goal is provide a clean pipeline for bringing custom onion services that 
cos host either simple HTTP page or custom protocols.

This project is not being actively maintained, as I do not have the time to invest in it as of now. But please, 
do have a look at the code.
